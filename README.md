## What requirements did you achieve?

I believe I have achieved all of the standard requirements and none of the stretch goals.

## Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I didn't have time to try and implement any of the stretch goals.

## Feedback requested:

- I still have issues with keeping things on my page centered when doing media queries. On my All Posts page, I found it difficult to try and keep the selection of posts centered on the page when the viewport width gets larger. I'm not sure what is the best way to combat this.

## What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

- I used ChatGTP to write my blog posts and my hero image on the homepage.
- The images I used for each blog post are hosted from Unsplash.
- I used W3Schools to help me split up my main content into sections as it initially rendered as one big chunk of text.

## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

I initially had hydration errors, but Manny helped me to understand that these could be due to some extensions that I have installed in my Chrome browser.
I kept having issues with the prop key being missing from certain elements. Especially on my dynamic post page, where I added another p tag to split my blog posts up into sections. A classmate helped me fix this by giving the second parameter as index and using the index as the id key.

I had another issue where my delete button worked the first time, but then didn't work again after that. Bertie helped me to fix this (although I can't remember the reason that it happened in the first place).

## What went really well and what could have gone better?

I have had issues with the styling - there is a slight issue where content is overflowing from its containers if a user is viewing the site on the smallest mobile size, but other sizes seem fine. I think this is because my browser does not go that small when I have my browser and VS Code side-by-side when I am working on a "mobile-first" concept.

I am happy that I managed to get all of the basic functionality of my app done before the weekend.
